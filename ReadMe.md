# My Postgres SQL Code Repository  

## SQL Practice Code Repository  

This repository contains a collection of SQL scripts that were created during my self-development journey in mastering SQL. The content here is inspired by lessons from the **"SQL for Data Analysis"** course offered by **Udacity**. This learning resource focuses on SQL fundamentals and advanced techniques useful for data analysis and manipulation.  

## Repository Overview  

The repository includes three SQL scripts, each exploring a specific aspect of SQL:

1. **`order-by.sql`**: Covers the `ORDER BY` clause, enabling sorting of query results in ascending or descending order.  
2. **`order-by-part-ii.sql`**: A continuation of the `ORDER BY` clause exploration, focusing on more advanced use cases.  
3. **`WHERE-statement.sql`**: Demonstrates filtering data using the `WHERE` clause to refine query results.  

These scripts were written as hands-on practice exercises to apply theoretical concepts from the course.  

## Key Details  

- The folder and file structure is straightforward to maintain clarity and accessibility.  
- Lessons learned while writing these scripts have contributed significantly to my growing expertise in SQL for real-world data analysis tasks.  

## Notes  

- The **"SQL for Data Analysis"** course on Udacity includes a range of topics like SQL joins, aggregations, subqueries, window functions, and performance tuning. This repository currently reflects only the foundational concepts that I have practiced, with plans for future additions as I progress through the course. I started the  course on Sun, 10th March 2024, 10:08:30 AM... still currently on it as time permits.
